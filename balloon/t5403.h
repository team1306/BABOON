t5403.h
Library for T5403 barometric pressure sensor.

The T5403 by Epcos is a low cost I2C barometric pressure sensor.  This sensor 
can be used in weather stations and for altitude estimations.  In this file are
the prototype functions in the T5400 class

Resources:
This library uses the Arduino Wire.h to complete I2C transactions.

Development environment specifics:
	IDE: Arduino 1.0.5
	Hardware Platform: Arduino Pro 3.3V/8MHz
	T5403 Breakout Version: 1.0

NOTE:  SPI is currently unsupported in the hardware.  If a release comes with
hardware support this file will be updated.  All reference to SPI is currently
a place holder for future development.

This code is beerware. If you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local pub, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!

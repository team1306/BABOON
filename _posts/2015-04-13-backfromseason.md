# Back from Build Season

After taking a long hiatus from this balloon project to work on the FIRST Robotics Competition [2015 challenge](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2015-game) [^1], we're happy to announce that we are returning to work on the space balloon!

We have some exciting news to share:
* Our team's main sponsor, Isthmus Engineering, has generously offered to let us launch from their building. We are extremely grateful for this opportunity.
* We have been able to streamline several of the balloon's components after returning with fresh minds:
	* We were able to remount all of the electronics on a breadboard, offering a physically stable environment for them to operate without worries of errant wires.
	* We reconfigured our tracking device, an Android smartphone running [SpaceTracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runninghusky.spacetracker&hl=en) and were able to do more advanced testing.
	* We've redesigned some of our enclosure to better suit the needs of our sensors, and will be reconstructing the window out of which the camera will take photos.
	
We will update this post with photos of our progress as soon as we can.

[^1]: Well, techincally we're not done yet, since we're attending the [FIRST Championship](http://firstchampionship.org/) after winning the Chairman's Award at the Wisconsin Regional. We were itching to get back to the balloon, though, so we started a little early.
